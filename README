Redux of my CS345H's Scala-Chef implementation.
https://github.com/l-hoang/scala-chef

Done to better organize the code into different files instead of having most
of it in 1 file (making it extremely hard to read/understand). Also done to 
clean up some of the DSL.

Organization is based off of how I did it for my other DSL, Gimme.



Title - "<insert title here>"



no heaped or level commands
no cooking time specification
<num> <ingrdient> doesn't work; need to do <num> ct <ingredient>
